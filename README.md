# KICKSTARTING ANALYSIS WITH EXCEL

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
A deep dive into Excel, as we know, Excel is a tool that can be used across all Organizations areas, including from household budgeting to complex financial analysis. 
Learning from the intricacies of Excel will draw on (and enhance) skills we may have already, like computer literacy, data literacy, and quantitative reasoning. 
Including advanced Excel features formulas, charts, and pivot tables. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Here's a quick look at the Kickstarting Analysis and Challenges of this Project, including the following tasks:

- Import data into a table for analysis.
- Apply filters, conditional formatting, and formulas.
- Generate and interpret pivot tables.
- Calculate summary statistics such as measures of central tendency, standard deviation, and variance.
- Characterize data to identify outliers in datasets.
- Perform an Excel analysis with visualizations.
- Interpret common Excel visualizations

#### Our Challenge Data Background
> Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
